    description: Power off or reboot Koishi
    usage: |-
      shutdown may be used to power off or reboot Koishi.
      The first argument may be a time string (which is usually "now").
      The time string may either be in the format "hh:mm" for hour/minutes specifying the time to execute the shutdown at, specified in 24h clock format. Alternatively it may be in the syntax "+m" referring to the specified number of minutes m from now.
      "now" is an alias for "+0", i.e. for triggering an immediate shutdown. If no time argument is specified, "+1" is implied.
      Optionally, this may be followed by a wall message to be sent to all logged-in users before going down.
    options:
      reboot: Soft reboot.
      rebootHard: Hard reboot.
      wall: Send wall message before power off or reboot.
      clear: Clear all pending shutdowns.
      show: List all pending shutdown actions.
    messages:
      no-pending: There's no pending shutdown.
